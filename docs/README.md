## Wordle

Here is a multiparty interactive game on web - Wordle.

You need to guess a word, and we will give each letter a color, and the colors must be red, yellow and green. Grey means that this letter isn't in the answer word. Yellow means that this letter appears in the answer word but not on its right position. Green means that you guess the letter on its right position.

For example, the answer is 'apple', and you give the word 'pears'. Because 'p', 'e', 'a' is in the answer and not in the correct position, so it'll show orange-orange-orange-grey-grey. If you give the word 'paper', it'll be orange-orange-green-orange-grey. If you give the word 'paple', it'll be orange-orange-green-green-green.

As mentioned above is Standard Rule. In addition, we also provide some more difficult and interesting rules for you to use.
